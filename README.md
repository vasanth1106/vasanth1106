springboot-react-social-login
The goal of this project is to implement an application called movie-app to manage movies. For it, we will implement a back-end application called movie-api using Spring Boot and a font-end application called movie-ui using ReactJS. Besides, we will use OAuth2 (Social Login) to secure both applications.

Applications
movie-api
Spring Boot Web Java backend application that exposes a Rest API to create, retrieve and delete movies. If a user has ADMIN role he/she can also retrieve information of other users or delete them. The application secured endpoints can just be accessed if a valid JWT access token is provided.

In order to get the JWT access token, the user can login using the credentials (username and password) created when he/she signed up directly to the application.

movie-api stores its data in MySQL database.

movie-api has the following endpoints

Endpoint	Secured	Roles
POST /auth/authenticate -d {"username","password"}	No	
POST /auth/signup -d {"username","password","name","email"}	No	
GET /public/numberOfUsers	No	
GET /public/numberOfMovies	No	
GET /api/users/me	Yes	ADMIN, USER
GET /api/users	Yes	ADMIN
GET /api/users/{username}	Yes	ADMIN
DELETE /api/users/{username}	Yes	ADMIN
GET /api/movies [?text]	Yes	ADMIN, USER
POST /api/movies -d {"imdb","description"}	Yes	ADMIN
DELETE /api/movies/{imdb}	Yes	ADMIN
movie-ui
ReactJS frontend application where a user with role USER can retrieve the information about movies. On the other hand, a user with role ADMIN has access to all secured endpoints, including endpoints to create and delete movies.

In order to access the application, a user or admin can login using his/her Github account or using the credentials (username and password) created when he/she signed up directly to the application. All the requests coming from movie-ui to secured endpoints in movie-api have the JWT access token. This token is generated when the user or admin logins.

movie-ui uses Semantic UI React as CSS-styled framework.

Creating OAuth2 apps for Social Login
Github

In this link, it's explained how to create a Github App

Note: Other providers like Facebook, Twitter, etc will be added later

How Social Login Works?
To explain how it works, we will use Github as OAuth2 provider example. By the way, this flow is similar to other providers. All the OAuth2 provider configuration is done in the application.yml. The oauth2Login configuration is done in WebSecurityConfig

The Social Login with Github starts with movie-app client redirecting the user to the following URL

http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorization/github
The OAuth2 provider will receive the request similar to

https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&scope=read:user&state=<STATE>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github
The user is redirected to the OAuth2 provider login form

https://github.com/login?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&return_to=/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github&response_type=code&scope=read:use&state=<STATE>
User provides his/her credentials

github-provide-credentials

User allows or denies the permissions to movie-app

github-authorize-permissions

If user denies permissions, the OAuth2 provider will redirect the user to the callback URL registered when creating the movie-app with an error.

The component that handles it is the Spring Boot default SimpleUrlAuthenticationFailureHandler. It can be customized if needed.

If user allows permissions, the OAuth2 provider will redirect the user to the callback URL registered when creating the movie-app with the authorization_code

The redirect URL will be similar to

http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github?code=<CODE>&state=<STATE>
Once received the redirect, Spring Security will exchange the authorization_code for an access_token and call CustomOAuth2UserService that will check (by username) whether the user is present or not in the movie-app database. If it is not present, a new entry for the user is created; otherwise, a few user information (like imageUrl and email) is updated.

In the end, the component CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler, extends SimpleUrlAuthenticationSuccessHandler, is invoked. It's responsible for creating a JWT access token and sending it to the user in the redirect_uri. We are using as redirect_uri a url present in movie-ui, http://localhost:3000/oauth2/redirect. The JWT token informed in the redirect_uri as a query string, like it's shown below

http://localhost:3000/oauth2/redirect?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...xaY0KWdqG2JDDk-iIrgIPDZvcA7Q

Docker
Docker-Compose
jq
Start Environment
Open a terminal and inside springboot-react-social-login root folder run

docker-compose up -d
Wait for mysql Docker container to be up and running. To check it, run

docker-compose ps
Running movie-app using Maven & Npm
movie-api

Open a terminal and navigate to springboot-react-social-login/movie-api folder

Export the following environment variables for the Client ID and Client Secret of the Social Apps (see how to get them in Creating OAuth2 apps for Social Login)

export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
Run the following Maven command to start the application

./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
movie-ui

Open another terminal and navigate to springboot-react-social-login/movie-ui folder

Run the command below if you are running the application for the first time

npm install
Run the npm command below to start the application

npm start
Applications URLs
Application	URL	Credentials
movie-api	http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html	
movie-ui	http://localhost:3000	admin/admin, user/user or signing up a new user
Demo
The gif below shows a user loging in using the Github

github-login

The gif below shows an admin loging in using his application account

admin-login

Testing movie-api Endpoints
Manual Test

Access movie-ui at http://localhost:3000

Click Login and then, connect with Github

Provide your Github credentials

Automatic Endpoints Test

Open a terminal and make sure you are in springboot-react-social-login root folder

Run the following script

./movie-api/test-endpoints.sh
It should return something like the output below, where it shows the http code for different requests
